                    "The HBO series was just taking off and I'd overheard workmates talking about it. That in itself would not have motivated me. But my sister
                    told me that once you start reading it was impossible to stop. The series, she told me, was Tolkienesque but also had elements of dynastic
                    rivalry much like the battle of royal houses in Dune. Now I've read both the Tolkien trilogy and Dune so I knew I had to give it a try. I 
                    bought a used paperback Game of Thrones, knowing it was a long series and thinking I would just read one to get a taste of it."

                    "My sister was right. And so beginning in the summer of 2012 and for the rest of the year I read one after the other. Ordering
                    the next used paperback on Amazon before I even finished the one I was with. Martin's ability to juggle so many plot elements
                    was very impressive and hugely enjoyable. Also, and Martin stated this in an interview, he uses magic only sparingly and thus heightens
                    the effect of, for example, the quasi baptism ritual of the Iron Islands in which people are revived after drowning."

                    "The result of this was to leave me out of a lot conversations. Especially during the most important episodes when it
                    was topic number one among friends and workmates. Every time I informed the people around me that I'd read every book
                    and wouldn't watch an episode I was given a collective cold shoulder."

                    "In an effort to make amends, to try to stay within the conversation to some degree, I would share some thoughts on casting choices, which
                    is one of the single most difficult aspects of having the literary experience. When you've formed the characters in your mind you have to come to
                    grips with how the show's creators populated the story. In the case of Tyrion Lannister, who, one can argue, is the closest to a bona fide protagonist
                    in a story with a multitude characters, the choice of Peter Dinklage was truly inspired."
